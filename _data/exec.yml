  hobbies: I love music so I arrange and play for the Intermission Orchestra. I enjoy the outdoors and my favorite sport is tennis. I play a large variety of different video games and sometimes stream on Twitch.
  whyBL: I've been playing league for 10 years now, so becoming involved with the Berkeley league community was a natural decision. I like sharing memories with and connecting the people that all share a passion for this game, and BL is the perfect place for me to do that. Hosting events and creating programs that can become a highlight of someone's week are what I strive to do in BL and beyond.

  hobbies: Sometimes I <a href="https://ev.berkeley.edu/">build racecars</a>, or host <a href="https://goldengateso.com/">science tournaments</a>, or make things look pretty, or cheer for Liquid.
  whyBL: I didn't really have a community to play games with throughout high school, so I was really excited to hear about a whole entire gaming club from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuU1vtrLXQw&list=ULMSQiYu89TXQ">Travis Gafford interview</a> and immediately got involved. I've met such a vibrant and varied community through Berkeley Legends and I want to make it as welcoming for others as it has been for me!
