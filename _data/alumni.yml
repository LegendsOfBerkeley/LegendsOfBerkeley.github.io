  champLane: I like Ashe... but I play mid lane. And yes, it's Mid & Feed.
  hobbies: I am ADDICTED to Milk Tea. I get at least one cup a day, and I think I’m starting to get diabetes… too much sugar. I need to stop, please remind me that if you ever see me with a cup :’(. I enjoy eating out a lot. I love any kinds of food and only milk tea. I enjoy watching TV shows if I’m not playing league. And my most recent hobby is playing with makeup. Please feel free to tell me if I suck at it and give me critiques to improve!
  whyBL: I’ve been playing league since end of Season one. My ELO for that season was around 800. This game is the most addicting game for me since Maplestory. As a result, coming from a high school without any sort of game-club and hearing that there’s a club specifically FOR a game I enjoy playing, I had to join. In a sense, it allows me to meet the person on the other side of the computer screen and meet new people since… most of my friends… play League. I don’t think I have that many friends who don’t. :);)

  champLane: During my spare time I like dominating bottom lane as Lulu (my favorite champion!) support.
  hobbies: Besides sharing my love for all things League of Legends related I like to take artsy pictures, play with my doge, lift heavy things and put them back down, or a combination of all three in that exact order.
  whyBL: I am extremely excited to be your Executive Officer for Berkeley Legends 2014-2015. I hope to show others what the League of Legends community, the game, and eSports are all about -- and how big the scene is becoming!

  champLane: Lux, because she's always a tactical decision!
  hobbies: K-pop is my jam and I always try to find time to listen to new songs and learn new dances. My favorite group happens to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/missA" target="_blank">miss A</a> but I’m totally up for discussing anything related to K-pop. I’m also a huge skincare addict, so I’ll often be at home doing facial masks and browsing the internet for ways to improve and to maintain healthy skin because I’m all about that Asian immortality. Feel free to hit me up about K-pop and skincare anytime and we can dance to the latest song while doing facial masks!
  whyBL: I am in Berkeley Legends because I really enjoy playing the game, but I also like having interaction with people outside the game. The club really does a good job of sparking conversations and making people feel comfortable within the community. Also, as a queer individual, I feel very obligated to make gaymers and other members of the LGBTQ League community feel welcome. I hope to build strong connections between members of the LGBTQ community in the future so that common feelings of isolation and loneliness will no longer be present.

  champLane: My favorite champ would have to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxZU1q_2yRo" target="_blank">Natalie</a> (nidalee? french maid or go home); AD Nid pre and post re-work.
  hobbies: If I’m not playing League, I’m honestly probably watching someone stream League. In the off-chance you catch me having a life, I’m exploring food places, hanging out with friends, or at a concert! I like a lot of music, from ODESZA to Porter Robinson to Childish Gambino to Yung Lean to “qvality” trap music.
  whyBL: I love the League fanbase and can’t get enough of these “e p i k m e m e s.” Honestly, I started coming out to viewing parties for the League of Legends swag, but I fell in love with the community here at Cal. I’m here to build those life-long relationships through league. I joined the Exec Team to get closer to this community and have an opportunity to help make Berkeley Legends great for everyone.

  champLane: Lee Sin jungle or Teemo top. Lee Sin because he’s probably the most fun champion in the game, and Teemo because I climbed to platinum with him (somehow)
  hobbies: I like to film and edit videos in my spare time as well as produce music on my computer! I play the cello and piano and own a keytar, so I like to jam. I’m really into esports so I end up spending a lot of my time reading LCS/OGN/LPL analysis and watching pro players stream when matches aren’t on and having a bit of banter with my friends about why TSM is (clearly) the best team in the world. Aside from that, I’m a big football (soccer) fan, and my favourite club is Arsenal FC!
  whyBL: As dorky as it may sound, LoL has been a catalyst for so many things in my life; friendships, rivalries, from feelings of jubilation and accomplishment to defeat - the game has given me so much, and I sought a group of people who are equally passionate about the game with whom to give back to the ever-growing community behind it, and that’s why I joined Berkeley Legends.

  hobbies: Swimming, biking, lifting (or any physical activities really), gaming (Dota, starcraft, Batman arkham series, Maplestory, Saints Row series, left 4 dead, borderlands ½, trying bioshock, miscellaneous horror games), rewatching the dark knight/fast and furious series, some anime while I’m eating, food hunting, go out on the streets and walk in a way that make people stare and wonder what’s wrong with me, change my desktop background, rant about facebook, play pointless phone games, drink soda and eat chips, and meditate, aka the legal (and natural) way to get high, hanging out with my favorite person ever
  whyBL: "Procedure: I tried to seduce my girlfriend while playing Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s get it on.”<br>
  Observation: She continued watching her movie and ignored me.<br>
  Conclusion: seductive music does not work on women."

  champLane: I really like Jayce and Lee Sin. Jayce was just my first love and I thought that he was so cool looking and hard to play when I first saw him, having the seven abilities rather than the standard four, and it seemed like he also had a really high skill cap to master over. Also, at the time when I was watching streams and pro-leagues online, I remember seeing people just owning with Jayce (season 3 worlds maybe??) CJ Shy especially being one of them. I thought Shy was a super god because of that and his play, and afterwards I would always tried to find Jayce montages of him pulling off epic moves and kills. Regarding Jayce’s high skill cap I also really liked how hard and horribly I failed the first time I playing with him. Getting better with him has been really rewarding and awesome to observe. Right now, as with his position in the current Meta, I only wish he was a little bit stronger in the meta though he has been getting picked back up again, especially at mid in the current season World’s :) Also, Lee Sin-wise, I really like Lee Sin because he’s super mobile and all the other awesome Lee Sin reasons most people like him haha. Lee sin’s a really sick champ as well overall.
  hobbies: I used to play soccer a lot in my free time and still do like to play soccer a decent amount, but not as much as I used to. Recently I’ve been trying to learn and get good at coding so I can build things at hackathons and the like. I also think these days that league’s been becoming a rather big time source too :p. Ohhh, and also, really, really like to play ping pong ever since I’ve been able to play so much in the dorms and the building lounges last year. Not very good at it but definitely always down to play haha!:p  Hit me up if you do too! xP.
  whyBL: Joined Berkeley Legends because League has become something more than just a game for me I believe, and its become a constantly changing challenge with so many unknowns and different variables that make it so challenging and addicting to get better at. I was also not really too involved in other clubs outside a select few I was a part of and thought that Berkeley Legends would be an awesome club to join and add on. Not to mention, the notion of joining a league related organization with lots of people who really like League and who I can share league fun with and learn from was really awesome. :)

  hobbies: I really enjoy looking at fashion blogs, hanging out at 723 Tea Station, and teaching CS61A. I play lots of other games too, but I’ve been busy this semester so I haven’t been able to keep up with anything besides LoL.
  whyBL: I realized that most of the friends I still keep in touch with from high school are friends who I’ve played League with over the years. It really got me to appreciate how awesome the game is and that I can get a lot out from playing besides better ELO. I wanted to help create a community on the UC Berkeley campus because so many people play here and I thought it would be awesome to have a space online where we could plan fun events and talk about anything and everything League related.
