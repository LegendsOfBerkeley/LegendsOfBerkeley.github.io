				<strong>Favorite Champ/Lane:</strong> I like Ashe... but I play mid lane. And yes, it's Mid & Feed.

				<strong>What do you like to do besides League?</strong> I am ADDICTED to Milk Tea. I get at least one cup a day, and I think I’m starting to get diabetes… too much sugar. I need to stop, please remind me that if you ever see me with a cup :’(. I enjoy eating out a lot. I love any kinds of food and only milk tea. I enjoy watching TV shows if I’m not playing league. And my most recent hobby is playing with makeup. Please feel free to tell me if I suck at it and give me critiques to improve!

				<strong>Why are you in Berkeley Legends?</strong> I’ve been playing league since end of Season one. My ELO for that season was around 800. This game is the most addicting game for me since Maplestory. As a result, coming from a high school without any sort of game-club and hearing that there’s a club specifically FOR a game I enjoy playing, I had to join. In a sense, it allows me to meet the person on the other side of the computer screen and meet new people since… most of my friends… play League. I don’t think I have that many friends who don’t. :);)

				<strong>What do you like to do besides League?</strong> Sometimes I <a href="https://ev.berkeley.edu/">build racecars</a>, or host <a href="https://goldengateso.com/">science tournaments</a>, or make things look pretty, or cheer for Liquid.
				<br>
				<strong>Why are you in Berkeley Legends?</strong> I didn't really have a community to play games with throughout high school, so I was really excited to hear about a whole entire gaming club from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuU1vtrLXQw&list=ULMSQiYu89TXQ">Travis Gafford interview</a> and immediately got involved. I've met such a vibrant and varied community through Berkeley Legends and I want to make it as welcoming for others as it has been for me!
